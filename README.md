## Getting Started
npm run dev

## Test task
  This is a task for testing your knowledge of React.js, HTML and CSS.
  In this task you will need to parse JSON provided below:

Once parsed you will need to create a React.js page using HTML and CSS to show
all the items in JSON.

  The statuses represent 3 states (they are not clickable, there is no need to change
the status on click of the item):
 +disabled (off toggle)
 +enabled (on toggle)
 +blocked (lock icon)
  When hovering over the item it should be highlighted as shown in the screenshot.

### Filtering
  A user should be able to filter by item name. If the item exists we hide other
records and show only found items in the list. If no records are found there should
be a message with a corresponding text.

### Sorting
  A user should be allowed to sort (ASC, DESC) by clicking on the titles.
